# Java practice

To run code clone the project goto any folder open your command line and type

` javac [ANY_FILENAME_WITH_EXTENSION] `
  
 ` Example: javac helloWorld.java `

Now it will create file which extension is class like

` HelloWorld.class `

To Print the Hello world type:

` java [YOUR_FILE_NAME]`

Example:

` java HelloWorld `

And you will get your first Hello world :) 

# Note: You must have installed JDK in your system other wise you will get error.
